### Task: Move the spider

Move the spider to the cursor on click.

**Requirements:**

- The spider center should come exactly under the pointer on click (without crossing the wall edge).
- The spider can not cross wall boundaries.
- When the page is scrolled, nothing should break.

**Notes:**

- The code should work with spider and walls of any sizes, do not use hardcoded sizes values.
- Use properties event.clientX/event.clientY to get click coordinates.
- You can modify only `src/scripts/main.js` file.
