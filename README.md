### Task: Move the spider

Move the spider across the wall to a click.

**Requirements:**

- The spider center should come exactly under the pointer on click (without crossing the wall edge).
- The spider must not cross wall boundaries.
When the page is scrolled, nothing should break.

**Notes:**

- The code should also work with different spider and
wall sizes, not be bound to any fixed values.
- Use properties event.clientX/event.clientY for
click coordinates.
- You must only modify the file `src/scripts/main.js`
